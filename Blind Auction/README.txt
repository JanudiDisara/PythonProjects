🏆 Blind Auction Program
---------------------------
A blind auction program written in Python, where multiple participants can place their bids confidentially. The program determines the highest bidder and announces the winner at the end.

🎯 How It Works
------------------
The program displays a welcome message with an ASCII logo.
Each participant enters their name and bid amount.
After each bid, the program asks if there are more bidders.
If yes, the screen is cleared, and the next participant enters their bid.
If no, the auction ends, and the highest bid is determined.
The program announces the winner with the highest bid.
