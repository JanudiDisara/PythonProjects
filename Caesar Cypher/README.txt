Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Program
--------------------------------------------------
Description
This program demonstrates basic encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique where each letter in the text is shifted by a specified number of positions in the alphabet. It includes an encrypt function to encode plain text by shifting each letter forward.

Features
Encrypts plain text using a given shift amount.
Demonstrates how each letter is shifted to produce the encrypted text.
	Example:
	Input: "hello"
	Shift Amount: 1
	Output: "ifmmp"

How It Works?
Each letter in the original text is shifted by the specified amount.
The built-in index() function is used to find the letter's position in the alphabet for shifting.
This project is a simple and fun introduction to basic encryption concepts! ðŸ˜Š
